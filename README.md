# Netflix_data_analysis
## Project Description

** Name of the project:** Netflix data analysis
** Data:** `netflix_titles`

This project is a data analysis case study on Netflix’s catalog of movies and TV shows, aimed at uncovering patterns, trends, and insights about the platform’s global content strategy. The dataset used contains metadata such as title, type (Movie/TV Show), director, cast, country of origin, release year, rating, and genre.

The workflow involved data cleaning and preprocessing (handling missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent formatting), followed by exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. Various visualizations were generated to examine how Netflix’s content has evolved over the years, which countries contribute the most titles, the balance between movies and TV shows, as well as the most common genres and rating categories.

Through this analysis, the project provides a comprehensive view of Netflix’s content library, highlights its expansion into international markets, and identifies the types of content that dominate its platform.


## Objective:
1. To explore and analyze Netflix’s dataset of movies and TV shows.
2. To perform data cleaning and preprocessing (handling null values, removing duplicates, and formatting data).
3. To generate insights through exploratory data analysis (EDA), such as:
   - Distribution of content by type (Movies vs TV Shows).
   - Trends of content released over time.
   - Country-wise production and availability.
   - Popular genres and ratings.
8. To visualize key patterns and trends in Netflix’s catalog using Python libraries.

## Business Questions explored in this project
In this project, several key business questions were explored to better understand Netflix’s catalog of movies and TV shows. These questions focused on content type, time trends, geography, genres, ratings, contributors, and duration.

Content Mix:
What proportion of Netflix’s catalog is made up of Movies compared to TV Shows?

- **Time Trends:** How has Netflix’s content library grown over the years? In which years did Netflix add the most titles?
      
- **Geography:** Which countries contribute the highest number of titles to Netflix? How much of the catalog comes from the U.S. versus international markets?

- **Genres:** What are the most common genres or categories among Movies and TV Shows? Which genres have been gaining popularity in recent years?

- **Ratings:** What are the most frequent audience ratings (e.g., TV-MA, R, PG)? Do ratings vary significantly by region?

- **Directors & Cast:** Who are the most frequently featured directors on Netflix? Which actors appear most often in Netflix’s productions?

- **Content Duration:** What is the distribution of movie durations across Netflix’s catalog? How many seasons do most TV Shows typically have?

## Findings of the project

Some of the insights to the above business questions are as follow:
- Movies dominate Netflix’s catalog, forming a much larger share compared to TV Shows.
- Significant surge in content addition after 2015, aligning with Netflix’s global expansion.
- Peak years of new releases are between 2017–2019.
- United States is the top content producer, followed by India and a few other countries.
- Content diversity has increased, with more titles coming from Asia, Europe, and Latin America in recent years.
- Drama, Comedy, and Documentaries dominate the catalog.
- Thriller, Action, and International TV Shows are also strong contributors.
- Most content is rated TV-MA (Mature Audiences) or R, reflecting Netflix’s focus on adult-oriented shows.
- Family/kids content exists but forms a smaller share.
- Some directors (especially from Bollywood and Hollywood) are highly frequent.
- A few actors appear in multiple Netflix productions, often tied to regional content strategies.
- Most movies are between 80–120 minutes.
- Outliers exist with very short or very long runtimes.
- Majority of TV Shows have only 1 season, indicating Netflix’s strategy of shorter limited series.
