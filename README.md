This project is a data analysis case study on Netflix’s catalog of movies and TV shows, aimed at uncovering patterns, trends, and insights about the platform’s global content strategy. The dataset used contains metadata such as title, type (Movie/TV Show), director, cast, country of origin, release year, rating, and genre.

The workflow involved data cleaning and preprocessing (handling missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent formatting), followed by exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. Various visualizations were generated to examine how Netflix’s content has evolved over the years, which countries contribute the most titles, the balance between movies and TV shows, as well as the most common genres and rating categories.

Through this analysis, the project provides a comprehensive view of Netflix’s content library, highlights its expansion into international markets, and identifies the types of content that dominate its platform.


## Objective:
1. To explore and analyze Netflix’s dataset of movies and TV shows.
2. To perform data cleaning and preprocessing (handling null values, removing duplicates, and formatting data).
3. To generate insights through exploratory data analysis (EDA), such as:
   - Distribution of content by type (Movies vs TV Shows).
   - Trends of content released over time.
   - Country-wise production and availability.
   - Popular genres and ratings.
8. To visualize key patterns and trends in Netflix’s catalog using Python libraries.

## Business Questions explored in this project
In this project, several key business questions were explored to better understand Netflix’s catalog of movies and TV shows. These questions focused on content type, time trends, geography, genres, ratings, contributors, and duration.

Content Mix:
What proportion of Netflix’s catalog is made up of Movies compared to TV Shows?

- **Time Trends:** How has Netflix’s content library grown over the years? In which years did Netflix add the most titles?
      
- **Geography:** Which countries contribute the highest number of titles to Netflix? How much of the catalog comes from the U.S. versus international markets?

- **Genres:** What are the most common genres or categories among Movies and TV Shows? Which genres have been gaining popularity in recent years?

- **Ratings:** What are the most frequent audience ratings (e.g., TV-MA, R, PG)? Do ratings vary significantly by region?

- **Directors & Cast:** Who are the most frequently featured directors on Netflix? Which actors appear most often in Netflix’s productions?

- **Content Duration:** What is the distribution of movie durations across Netflix’s catalog? How many seasons do most TV Shows typically have?

## Findings of the project

Some of the insights to the above business questions are as follow:
1. It is recommended to add focus on R and TV-MA rated movies while considering to add content for US, UK and Canada. For India the focus should be on movies with rating TV-14.
2. while considering to add more TV shows Netflix can adopt various approches:
      i. When considering for global audiance TV shows with rating TV-MA should be preffered as it.
      ii. When considering country specific audiance, it is recommended to add TV shows specific to countries like TV-MA rating shows for US, India, and UK. while for Camada It shold focus on adding more TV shows with Tv-Y rating.
3. Additionally, Netflix can experiment adding TV shows with TV-Y rating in India. Since, This TV shows with rating TV-Y is not available in India, it is unknown how would Indians react to such content. So, There is a scope of experimentation
4. Netflix or OTT platforms in general are recommended to add content of length 90-120 minutes for US, Uk, and Canadians while for India longer format movies are recommended (120-150 minutes). However, for global audiance, the movies with length 90-120 minutes should be preffered.
5. It is recommended that for India shorter format of TV shows should be preffered to produce or to be added for OTT audiance while for US, UK, and canada, longer format would also work.
6. For global audiance, TV shows preferably of one season should be focussed.
7. In India, documentry type zenre are not very popular both in movies as well as TV Shows. while other countries US, UK, and Canada there are considerable no. of documetry Zenre contents. So, While adding contnets on Netflix or on OTT platforms in general, this maybe cared.
8. Short length of movies are not very prevalent in India on Netflix while in rest of the countries US, UK, and Canada, a good number of short length content were present.

#### ***There is not enough data presnet to provide a lot of business apllicable insights. For example, if data on watching indecies were present or cost and revenue indices were present, a robust analysis could have been done and a lot of business insights could have been drawn***
